I am a developer at Crelate, where I ensure data migrations run smoothly. I also help create the cutting edge features that keep our app in the top 10 on review sites like Capterra and Getapp.

Originally from Cleveland I moved to Seattle in 2012, with my girlfriend Emy, in order to advance my career in software development. In my spare time you can usually find me tinkering with my electric bike, hiking around the city or playing video games. You might also find me walking my dog Bear, he is a rotweiler/cattle dog mix and always rearing to go.
